Assignment #3

Instructions:
This assessment task requires you to make an interactive game. 
When the game starts, five faces are shown on the left and four are shown on the right. This is illustrated below
The left and right sides are identical, except for one thing: the left side has one extra face. 
The user needs to click on that extra face. 
If anything except the correct face is clicked, a message is displayed saying that the game is over. 
If the correct face is clicked, all the currently displayed faces are deleted and a new set of faces is shown at random positions. 
Each time a new set of faces is shown there will be 5 more faces than before, on both the left and the right sides. 
There will always be one extra face shown on the left.

For example, let’s imagine you are playing the game shown in the previous figure. After clicking on the extra face (at the top) all the faces disappear and the following new set of faces are shown. As you can see, on both sides 5 more faces than before are shown
There are 4 parts of this assessment. 
You need to submit 1 file for each part. 
For each part you can only submit one single HTML file, which (for parts 2, 3 and 4) includes JavaScript code within it. 
That means there are no links to external JavaScript files or CSS files in this assessment task.

Here are the more specific requirements and further information for both parts.

Overview of the Parts

Part 1 – developing the web page content without JavaScript

Part 2 – generating the left side images

Part 3 – handling the right side

Part 4 – finishing the game
