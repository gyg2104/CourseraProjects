Assignment #2
Instructions:
There are 2 parts of this assessment. You need to submit 1 file for part 1 and 1 file for part 2. 
For both part 1 and part 2 you can only submit one single HTML file, which includes the JavaScript code within it. 
That means there are no links to external JavaScript files or any other files in this assessment task.

Part 1 is a simple version of the game. 
When the file is loaded a color is randomly selected from an array of colors 
and a loop begins which repeatedly asks the player what the color is. 
However, no feedback is given to the player depending on what he/she enters. 
The loop simply finishes when the player enters the correct color. 
Make sure you save a copy of this as, for example, part1.html, before you move on to the next part.

For Part 2, take your part 1 file and extend it by completing the entire game. 
Make sure you save a copy as, for example, part2.html.
